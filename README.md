# WayIn: Accessible Campus Navigation

## Inspiration
As students on a large college campus, we often face challenges locating open building entrances, especially after hours or during the start of a new term. Recognizing that individuals with disabilities might encounter even greater difficulties when seeking accessible entrances, we developed **WayIn**. Our goal is to simplify navigation for everyone, ensuring that everyday tasks, such as finding building entrances, are made easier and more inclusive.

## What It Does
**WayIn** is a mobile map application that identifies accessible and open campus building entrances, offering users specific directions to their chosen destinations. Its standout feature is the ability to filter entrances based on accessibility needs, allowing users to navigate with ease and confidence.

## How We Built It
- **Prototype**: Designed on **Figma**, focusing on a clean and accessible user interface.
- **Frontend Development**: Built using **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript** within **Visual Studio Code**.
- **API Integration**: Incorporated **Google Maps/Cloud APIs** for real-time navigation and mapping.
- **Data Source**: Integrated features from UW’s Accessible Guide Map to locate and distinguish between standard and accessible entrances.

## Challenges
- **Learning Curve**: With limited experience in coding and APIs, we faced difficulties mastering platforms such as VSCode and Google Maps API on the spot.
- **Tight Timeline**: The complexity of combining various project elements within the short duration of the hackathon was a major hurdle.
- **Integration Issues**: Despite these challenges, we devised a cohesive and viable solution with future scalability in mind.

## Accomplishments
- Successfully developed and presented a functional Figma prototype.
- Delegated tasks effectively, leveraging team members' strengths.
- Learned and applied multiple programming languages and technologies during the hackathon.

## What We Learned
- **Technical Skills**: Enhanced our understanding of Google Maps API and its features.
- **Teamwork**: Gained valuable experience in collaboration, problem-solving, and task delegation, which were crucial for overcoming obstacles as a team of novice coders.

## What's Next for WayIn
- **Real-Time Data**: Request access to UW’s real-time building entrance availability and integrate it into the app.
- **Full-Stack Development**: Transition from prototype to full-stack implementation.
- **Scalability**: Expand WayIn to other university campuses and potentially integrate it into Google Maps.
- **Enhancements**: Redefine navigation systems to mitigate accessibility issues globally.
